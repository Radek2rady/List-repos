        SpongeBob SquarePants (voiced by Tom Kenny) is a yellow anthropomorphic sea sponge who usually wears brown short
        pants,
        a white collared shirt, and a red tie. He lives in a pineapple house and is employed as a fry cook at a fast
        food restaurant called the Krusty Krab.[16] He diligently attends Mrs. Puff's Boating School but has never
        passed; his lack of a driver's license is a running gag throughout the series. He is relentlessly optimistic and
        enthusiastic toward his job and his friends. SpongeBob's hobbies include catching jellyfish, blowing bubbles,
        playing with his best friend Patrick, and unintentionally irritating his neighbor Squidward. He first appears in
        "Help Wanted".[17]

      <article>
        Patrick Star (voiced by Bill Fagerbakke) is a pink starfish who lives under a rock and wears flowered swim
        trunks.
        His most prominent character trait is his extremely low intelligence. He is best friends with SpongeBob and
        often unknowingly encourages activities that get the two into trouble.[16] While typically unemployed throughout
        the series, Patrick holds various short-term jobs as the storyline of each episode requires.
        He is generally slow and easy-going but can sometimes get aggressive, much like real starfish, and occasionally
        performs feats of great strength.[20]

      <h4 id="krabs" >Krabby Krab</h4>
      <article>
        Eugene Krabs (voiced by Clancy Brown), more commonly known as Mr. Krabs, is a red crab who owns and operates the
        Krusty Krab restaurant where SpongeBob works. He is self-content, cunning, and obsessed with the value and
        essence of money.[16] He lives in an anchor-shaped house with his teenage daughter Pearl, who is a whale. He
        dislikes spending money but will go to great lengths to make Pearl happy.[18]
        He tends to worry more about his riches than about the needs of his employees. Having served in the navy, he
        loves sailing, whales, sea shanties, and talking like a pirate.
